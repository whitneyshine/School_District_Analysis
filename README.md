# School_District_Analysis

**Overview of the school district analysis: <br><br>**
Maria and her supervisor have been notified by the School Board that there is evidence of unethical academic behavior within the School District.  The Thomas High School 9th Graders appear to have had their reading as well as their math grades altered, and the full extent of the unethical academic behavior is currently unknown by the School Board. Maria has asked that I rework the school district analysis I did recently gave her and replace the reading and math grades for the 9th Grade Thomas High School students with NaNâ€™s. After the intensive rework is done, Maria would like a report that describes the full impact to the overall analysis from the changes she has requested. <br>
